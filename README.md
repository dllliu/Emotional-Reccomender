# Emotional-Coaster

# Description

This project was created for NYUHacks 2023. This project is a cross between a digital "diary" record system and sentiment analysis.
On the landing page (which can be accessed by 'cd app' after 'cd Emotional-Reccomender'), please first register for a new account. Then, please log in with your previously established credentials. The login page will then redirect to the home page, where you will enter any relevant emotional feelings or moments you may have had or are having. NLP from Co:here will be used for sentiment analysis of the prompt and classify the emotion you are experiencing. Then, a reccomendation system will look at the emotion you are experiencing to give you reccomendations for what to do when you are experiencing the emotion. A digital record will be kept of all user entries, which will allow the user to see how their experiences/moments/emotions have changed over time.
